            <p>Share Our America&rsquo;s inaugural pilot, jointly run by the <strong>Belfer Center for Innovation &amp; Social Impact</strong> at <strong>92NY</strong> and the <strong>Episcopal Diocese of Nebraska</strong>, brought together participants representing a spectrum of political perspectives, religious values and traditions, and lived experiences. Over four days, participants got to know each other through facilitated conversations about their differences, social activities, shared meals, a homestay, a visit to a local ranch, and all the moments in between.</p>
