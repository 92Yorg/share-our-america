            Share Our America is a domestic cultural exchange program bringing Americans of different
            backgrounds closer together. With an initial focus on adults 60+, participants will travel to
            parts of the U.S. they haven&rsquo;t been exposed to and explore life through a local perspective,
            building towards greater empathy and understanding.</p>
            <p>Political, ideological, and geographic polarization are on the rise in America. Over the past 25 years,
                Americans have moved further apart on issues. Today, partisanship is the dividing factor on policy
                issues &dash; surpassing age, race / ethnicity, education, gender, and religion.</p>
            <p>As polarization rises, Americans increasingly dislike, distrust, and dehumanize one another, with 42% of
                partisans seeing the “other side” as evil and >50% of Americans having few or no friends from the
                opposing political party. This has dire consequences for our country.</p>
            <p>However, we are ready for change: 86% of Americans think we can improve our trust in one another and many
                highlight the importance of engagement with local communities to do so. Drawing on research-backed
                strategies to bridge divides, Share Our America is a unique domestic cultural exchange program, bringing
                Americans of different backgrounds closer together.</p>
            <p>Participants will travel to Chadron, NE, a rural community in the picturesque pine ridge of Western
                Nebraska. During the 4 day, 3 night experience, participants will stay with local hosts and explore life through the
                community&rsquo;s perspective. We will spend a day shadowing a farmer or rancher, socialize with the community, do a
                service activity, and deepen our understanding of different viewpoints through facilitated dialogues.</p>
