            <p>Share Our America&rsquo;s inaugural pilot was jointly run by the Belfer Center for Innovation & Social Impact at 92NY and the Episcopal Diocese of Nebraska. A small group of participants from rural Nebraska met over four days with urban and suburban areas across the United States, including California, New Jersey, New York and Florida.</p>

            <p>Participants worked through facilitated conversations about their differences, social activities, shared meals, a homestay, a visit to a local ranch, and all the moments in between.</p>

            <p>Supported by Essential Partners, a global leader in dialogue and facilitation, 92NY and the Episcopal Diocese facilitated group conversations that encouraged participants to share personal stories and listen without judgment. The group bonded over discussions of family, what Main Street means to them, and how they want to continue to have more meaningful conversations across differences in their towns and communities.</p>
