            <p>In Share Our America&rsquo;s inaugural pilot, jointly run by the Belfer Center for Innovation & Social Impact at 92NY and the Episcopal Diocese of Nebraska, participants representing a spectrum of political perspectives, religious traditions, and lived experiences came together in northwest Nebraska to share their personal stories and learn from each others&rsquo; differences. Over four days, participants got to know each other through facilitated conversations about their differences, social activities, shared meals, a homestay, a visit to a local ranch, and all the moments in between.</p>

            <p>The small group of participants hailed from rural Nebraska, and urban and suburban areas across the United States, including California, New Jersey, New York and Florida.</p>

            <p>Supported by Essential Partners, a global leader in dialogue and facilitation, 92NY and the Episcopal Diocese facilitated group conversations that encouraged participants to share their personal stories and listen without judgment. The group bonded over discussions of family, what Main Street means to them, and how they want to continue to have more meaningful conversations across differences in their towns and communities.</p>
