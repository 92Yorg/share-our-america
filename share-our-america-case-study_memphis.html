      <h1>Unpacking incarceration, economic inequality, and safety</h1>
      <h4>Memphis, Tennessee</h4>
      <p>March and April, 2023</p>

    <div class="page-layout u-constrained u-constrained--skinny">
      <p>
        Communities across Memphis gathered in the Spring of 2023 to discuss and
        define what safety means in their community. They covered pressing
        topics including youth violence, economic stagnation, inequality, and
        incarceration. Neighbors found neighbors, differences were cherished
        instead of dismissed, and collective power was discovered across shared
        values. The result? An ongoing commitment to co-creating solutions for
        their city.

        Despite recent threats to Tennessean democratic institutions and safety,
        leaders on-the-ground were inspired to bring Share Our America to their
        communities. Built over the course of eight months to train leaders and
        recruit participants, the series of five gatherings in Memphis offered
        the space to level set across lived experiences and build the foundation
        for lasting relationships.

        Tennesseans Tanja Mitchell and Andrea Fenise organized these gatherings,
        bringing together local leaders, business owners, community advocates,
        and faith-based organizations to better understand who they are &mdash;
        and how their lived experiences brought them to their beliefs today.

              After our gathering, I now feel confident that I can make an
              impact as a community builder. Share Our America&rsquo;s resources
              were a catalyst needed to push me toward what I now feel is my
              life work.

              I saw people open up when they had a safe space for these
              conversations—they were authentic and human with each other,
              despite the challenging topics and different perspectives. These
              conversations are where real change can begin, and this was just
              the beginning.
