            <p>Communities across Memphis gathered to better understand their differences across youth violence, economic stagnation, inequality, and safety. Neighbors found neighbors, differences were set aside, and new friendships were forged. They discovered their collective power, resonated across their shared values, and committed to co-creating solutions for their city.</p>

Built over the course of eight months to train leaders and recruit participants, the series of five gatherings in Memphis offered the space to level set across lived experiences and forge meaningful, lasting relationships.</p>
