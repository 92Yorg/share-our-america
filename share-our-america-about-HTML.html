					Share Our America experiences are rooted in local communities and places, co-designed and led by community organizations and leaders across the United States who believe that change can happen in our country &mdash; and that begins on a one-to-one basis, person by person, community by community. Through Share Our America experiences, participants connect over shared meals, shared experiences, through social events, and facilitated conversations about their differences.

					The design for Share Our America was developed by the Belfer Center for Innovation & Social Impact at The 92nd Street Y, New York (92NY) using research-backed strategies to reduce polarization, in close collaboration with industry experts in cultural exchange and building connection across difference.
