            <h1>Building understanding between high school students and law enforcement</h1>
            <h4>North Penn School District, Pennsylvania</h4>
            <p>December 5 and 12, 2022</p>

        <div class="page-layout u-constrained u-constrained--skinny">
            <p>What does safety look like—and how can communities collectively reimagine it? Over two evening sessions, a group of high school students from the North Penn School District, their parents and guardians, and representatives from four police precincts worked together to define what a safe community means to them. Students shared their experiences with law enforcement and their perceptions of them from social media. Police officers shared their hopes to build meaningful relationships with students and community members, and parents and guardians spoke to  their own values and perceptions.</p>

            <p>Connecting across their different identities, generations, races and ethnicities—and sharing  personal perspectives—led to moments of discovery and understanding. Participants recognized the value in listening to each other, asked thoughtful questions, and imagined together how to create a more open and respectful community.</p>

            <h3>After the gathering</h3>
            <p>Since the gathering, North Penn School District administrators brought what was reimagined to all seven  police precincts that serve their district. As a result, new policies were proposed that redefine how police will be present on campus going forward. The school district will additionally host Share Our America gatherings every semester—which means more students, their families, and law enforcement officers can meaningfully connect and co-create a safer community together. </p>
