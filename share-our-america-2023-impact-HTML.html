            <p>Initiated in 2021 by the 92NY&rsquo;s Belfer Center for Innovation & Social Impact (the founders of Giving Tuesday, Ben Franklin Circles, Women inPower, and the Social Good Summit), we resource local leaders with the knowledge and materials to design their own Share Our America gatherings. We use researched-backed facilitated dialogue, intergroup contact theory, and shared meals proven to repair relationships and bring people away from what they hear in the news and toward who is in front of them. We aren&rsquo;t reinventing the wheel &mdash; we&rsquo;re reinventing who gets it.</p>
            
            <p>When 86% of Americans think we can improve our trust in one another, we need the intentional time, space, and resources to rebuild trust and co-create solutions to the problems we face.</p>
