            <p>Share Our America has helped communities redefine public safety on high school campuses, equipped local business owners to become community champions, and inspired hundreds of everyday people to forge unlikely relationships &mdash; and we aren&rsquo;t stopping there.</p>

            <p>Initiated in 2021 by the 92NY&rsquo;s Belfer Center for Innovation & Social Impact (the founders of Giving Tuesday, Ben Franklin Circles, Women inPower, and the Social Good Summit), we resource local leaders with the knowledge and materials to run their own Share Our America gatherings. We use research-backed facilitated dialogue, intergroup contact theory, and shared meals proven to repair relationships and bring us away from what we hear in the news and toward the people around us.</p>
            
            <p>86% of Americans think we can improve our trust in one another. That&rsquo;s why Share Our America allows participants to step outside preconceived notions, reconnect, and create the foundation for change in their community.</p>
